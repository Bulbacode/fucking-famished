# FuckingFamished.com
A website designed to imitate the beloved WTFSIGTE. This repository is the angular front end, for the api check [fucking-famished-api](https://github.com/Bulbacode/fucking-famished-api)

## Why am I making this?
I am a content-creator [on TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@bulbacode) who preaches the importance of thinking for yourself and not going to college for a computer science degree. Instead contributing to projects and building a portfolio should be priority no 1.

To help facilitate this I want to build simple apps and websites that my viewers can come in and contribute to. Feel free to log bugs, feature enhancements as often as you'd like to help out the contributing devs to solve some problems they can show on their resumes.

## How to Build Locally
To build locally, navigate to local directory and run 
`ng serve`

That will host the front-end locally on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

*Note - the backend api needs to be running locally as well for the requests to make it out.
